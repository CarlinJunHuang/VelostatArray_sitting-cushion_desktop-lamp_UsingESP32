# Velostat sensor array for the IoT interaction system between pressure sitting cushion and desktop lamp
 
Futher description would be uploaded within 10 days(expected, but I'm too lazy to upload it :D. Pls just waiting for another 10 days~).

We are sitting a new team, and working really hard on making this project a open-source pressure-array kit, 
which can release future developer, designer, research of this field from repeated work.

This is supposed to be a really promising project, so pls keep an eye on it.
If you are interested in it, pls give us a StarðŸŒŸ. We will upload our final work of Pressure-array Kit once we completed all the core jobs.
